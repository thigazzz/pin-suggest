## Motivation
The motivation behind PinSuggest is twofold. Firstly, it aims to assist individuals who, like me, struggle to choose an image from a vast selection available on Pinterest. This can be particularly overwhelming when searching for inspiration or specific themes. Secondly, this project serves as a platform for me to enhance my technical skills, particularly in Python programming, web scraping, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA). By tackling a real-world problem and implementing a practical solution, I hope to refine my abilities in designing, developing, and testing applications.
